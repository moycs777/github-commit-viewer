# Fulltime Force Test

First clone the repo or download it after that 
open a terminal in the project folder

This repo contains 2 projects front and backend.

Make sure you have available ports: 3000(front) and 10000(backend)

# front 

## Installation

```bash
cd front && npm i
```

## Usage

```bash
 npm run start
```

It should open in your default browser the front-end client




# backend 

Now open another terminal in the location of the cloned/downloaded project.

```bash
cd backend && npm i
```

```bash
 npm run start
```

If you like you could run test inside each project terminal with the command:
```bash
 npm run test
```
