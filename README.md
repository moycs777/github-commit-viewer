# Fulltime Force Test

First clone the repo or download it after that 
open a terminal in the project folder

This repo contains 2 projects front and api.

Make sure you have available ports: 3000(front) and 10000(api)
```bash
front
```

## Installation

```bash
cd front && npm i
```

## Usage

```bash
 npm start
```

It should open in your default browser the front-end client



```bash
api
```
Now open another terminal in the location of the cloned/downloaded project.

```bash
cd api && npm i
```

```bash
 npm run start
```

If you like you could run test inside each project terminal with the command:
```bash
 npm run test
```
